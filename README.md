# single_degree_earthquake_triggering
The code simulates earthquakes, using single degree of freedom spring spring slider model. The frictional interface obeys empirical rate-and-state friction. 
The code requires numpy, numba, pandas, toolboxes. Optionally, one may use obspy and multiprocessing toolboxes.
